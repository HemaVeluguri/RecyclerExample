# RecyclerExample
This project displays the images and titles of branches available in Engineering in Recyclerview.
The Recyclerview widget is more advanced and flexible version of ListView.
The main difference between Recyclerview and Listview is when implementing a recyclerview,a seperate class is used to define a ViewHolder
object which is used by adapter to bind viewholder with a position.It makes implementation complex,but solves the issues faced in ListView.
In implementing recyclerview rowdesign should be made showing how the item should appear.
